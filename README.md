# Decision_Trees1

Please open the file: Compulsory Task 1.ipynb

Tasks:

Create a Bagged, Random Forest, and Boosted tree for the titanic dataset in the same way that you created a regular Classification Tree.

From the Random Forest model, determine which of the features is the one that contributes the most to predicting whether a passenger survives or not.

Pick one of these methods, and tune the parameters n_estimators and max_depth.

Report the accuracy of all models and report which model performed the best, including the values for n_estimators and max_depth that the best model had.
